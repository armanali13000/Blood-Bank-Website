Project Title:  Life Bridge 
Life Bridge is online web based project. Today you can connect with anything through internet services. So online platform is the best choice for our project. The project aims at serving for human welfare.
The project Life Bridge focuses on efficient delivery of blood packets. 
The main aim of the project relies on efficient transaction of blood packets between Hospitals and Blood banks while connecting with the user at both the ends. This result in a three-way communication between the Blood Bank Hospital and the User.
The project in the form of a User friendly website is an efficient way of communication.
The hospitals and the blood banks uses a common database which store information regarding the blood packets, 
So life bridge aims to build a better interface between donors and those in need of blood.

Blood Bank should maintain adequate bloodstock and should make optimal use of available blood packets. It should provide blood packets which are as safe as possible and adequate to meet the patients need in the least amount of time.
